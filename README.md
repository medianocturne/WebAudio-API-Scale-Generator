# WebAudio-API-Scale-Generator
<h2>A web app that utilizes Web Audio API via Javascript, HTML, CSS to create a variety of musical scales, ascending and descending, in all keys.  As all audio is created via oscillators in HTML5, it should be compatible with iOS and most browsers, and the script includes webkit compatibility.</h2>

Future revisions will include bpm (almost done).. different sound profiles, looping (also nearly done), metronome integration, and more.  

A functional version of this will be available at <strong>http://www.medianocturne.com/scalegenerator/index.html</strong>
